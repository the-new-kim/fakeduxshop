Next.js + Redux

## What I learned...

- the basic usage of Redux
- SSR, SSG, ISR of Next.js

## What I did...

- Persistence with Redux & LocalStorage maually
- ExchangeRates will be fetched if the existing timestamp is older than 24hours

## What I tried...

- next-redux-wrapper => ?
- Initializing redux store with the data from "getStaticProps", but why?
- redux-persist (this broke SSR...)

## What's next

- Keep learning Redux (RTK Query, API, Middleare etc)
